## ðŸŽ® **Computer Games Sales Analysis Project**

### **Project Objective**
The objective of this project is to analyze historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms to identify key patterns that contribute to the success of video games. By understanding these patterns, we can provide insights into what makes a game successful and how different factors such as genre, platform, and ratings influence game sales.

### **Project Description**
